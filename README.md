# Railroad-ModPack
 A bunch of mods that the Railroad Radio crew have tested quite thoroughly and play really well together.

 Wanted to create a modpack where I could do version control for mod updates, and only upgrade when versions are compatible. Specifically so that when I do find a working version upgrade, I don't have to walk every single person through which mods to upgrade.

### Version 0.1.2 - Upgrading to versions
  Removed DullNevCards, added MadCards. Upgraded everything to most recent.

### Version 0.1.1 - First upload
  Current Mod versions are working well, Its the most stable game of rounds we have had in a long time.

  Just added the CR card pack however, and have noticed some of the CR cards can drasticaly decrease performance and cause crashes with the right pairings. But disabling the CR cards, the game will be really stable.
